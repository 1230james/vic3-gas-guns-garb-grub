# Gas, Guns, Garb, and Grub

For Victoria 3

## Overview

**Gas, Guns, Garb, and Grub** (GGGG, 4G) is a mod for [Victoria 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/) which adjusts and adds production methods for barracks, conscription centers, and naval bases to replicate the need and development of fuel, firearms, fashion, and food for your military.

4G both adds new production methods and adjusts existing ones to implement its changes. Changes include three new production method groups with all-new production methods allowing you to outfit your armies and navies with the latest in uniform archetypes and furnish your soldiers and crewmen with increasingly fresh rations as technology develops. A third production method group exists exclusive for armies to give you control over how your infantry is armed, disconnecting it from your army organization production methods. As better types of firearms are developed, your infantry can go to battle with increasingly powerful weapons - or if times get rough, they may be forced to fight with more primitive arms.

Adjustments to existing production methods include the aforementioned decoupling of firearms technology from the infantry organization production methods, as well as adjusting all navy production methods to include coal and oil usage to better represent the cost of operation of more advanced warships sailing under power.

## Compatibility Considerations

The most likely point of conflict between 4G and other mods will be the changes to GUIs this mod makes. If you are trying to create a compatibility patch with another mod, all changes made in vanilla .gui files should be marked with a "GGGG" comment.

For ease of checking if this mod is active, 4G adds a global variable of boolean type named `GGGG_is_active`. It will always evaluate to true (`yes`) if this mod is active.
